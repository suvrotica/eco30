# Extant Platforms

These are three different technologies or platforms related to environmental sustainability and carbon footprint reduction similar to Eco30.

## C3

Is a carbon capture technology developed by Carbon Clean Solutions that captures carbon dioxide from industrial processes and converts it into useful products or stores it safely underground. This technology has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of various industries, including power generation, cement production, and petrochemicals, but its implementation can be complex and expensive.

## Toucan Protocol

Is a blockchain-based platform that provides a transparent and traceable way for individuals and organizations to invest in verified carbon credits and offset their carbon footprint. Carbon credits are certified by various international standards such as the Verified Carbon Standard and the Gold Standard, ensuring their credibility and legitimacy.

## Moss.Earth

Is a platform that uses blockchain technology to provide a transparent and traceable way for individuals and organizations to invest in nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and conservation projects, to offset their carbon footprint. In addition to investing in projects, Moss.Earth also offers tools for individuals and organizations to track and reduce their carbon footprint, promoting a more sustainable lifestyle.

There are various open source technologies that can be used to tokenize carbon credits using blockchain technology. These technologies can help to create a more transparent and efficient way to manage carbon credits and reduce carbon emissions.

## OpenTree platform

This is a blockchain-based platform for managing and tracking the life cycle of trees. The platform allows organizations to issue digital tokens that represent carbon credits for trees at different stages of growth, from seed to mature tree. These tokens can then be traded on a blockchain-based marketplace, providing a transparent and efficient way to invest in carbon credits.

## Hyperledger Fabric

Another open source technology that can be used for tokenizing carbon credits is the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. Hyperledger Fabric provides a modular architecture for building blockchain-based applications and has been used in various carbon credit tokenization projects. This technology offers a high degree of customization and flexibility, making it suitable for complex carbon credit tokenization projects.

There are also other blockchain-based platforms and technologies that can be used for tokenizing carbon credits, such as the Ethereum blockchain and the CarbonX platform. The choice of technology will depend on the specific requirements of the project and the expertise of the development team. The use of open source technologies ensures transparency, security, and flexibility in carbon credit tokenization.

Each project and protocol has its unique features and benefits that cater to different needs and requirements in the carbon offsetting and sustainability sector. The use of blockchain technology enables transparency, accountability, and traceability in the carbon offsetting process, which is crucial for ensuring the legitimacy and effectiveness of sustainable projects. As the demand for sustainable practices and carbon offsetting increases, we can expect to see more innovative blockchain-based solutions in this field.

In our approach, we will leverage the canonical versions of various existing platforms and protocols like c3, Toucan Protocol, Moss Earth, OpenTree Platform, Hyperledger Fabric, Carbon Grid, OpenClimate, Climatecoin, Carbon Delta, and Carbon Initiative. These platforms have already established a standard, common-sense approach to address carbon offset and climate-related challenges.

Each of these platforms has built a layer of specificity on top of the canonical version, tailoring it to their unique requirements and use-cases. Our goal is to integrate the best aspects of these platforms to create a customized solution that suits our specific needs. We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each platform, identify the key features and functionalities that we can adapt, and re-engineer those elements to fit our requirements.

For instance, we could leverage Hyperledger Fabric's permissioned blockchain technology for secure and transparent transaction records. We might also benefit from OpenClimate's comprehensive approach to climate data and policy management. Additionally, Moss Earth's experience with forest conservation projects could provide valuable insights into effective carbon offset strategies.

By carefully selecting the best aspects of each platform and re-engineering them to create a unified, cohesive system, we can develop a powerful, tailored solution that addresses our climate goals while ensuring efficiency, transparency, and scalability.
