# Project Carbon Token

The Carbon Token Platform is an innovative project that aims to revolutionize the carbon market by incorporating blockchain technology, smart contracts, and AI-driven data analytics. The platform is designed to make the process of purchasing and managing carbon tokens easy and efficient for users.

### Components

Component diagrams are used to visualize the organization and relationships among software components in a system. They depict high-level components, their interactions, and the dependencies between them. This type of diagram is particularly useful for representing the architecture of a software system and helps in understanding the functionality and organization of different components.

The platform allows users to buy and manage carbon tokens through a user-friendly website. When users interact with the website, they can view their carbon token balance and purchase more tokens. The platform uses a digital record book called a blockchain to keep track of all token transactions. Automatic agreements called smart contracts take care of buying tokens and adding transactions to the blockchain. The platform also includes a smart computer program that generates helpful data for decision-making and improvements, and a data analytics component that analyzes this data and updates the number of carbon tokens each user has.

## Project Overview

The project revolves around the issuance of carbon tokens on the Polygon blockchain. By tying these tokens to reforestation efforts, the project aims to create a tangible and measurable impact on global carbon sequestration. The tokens will be used as a means of incentivizing reforestation activities and allowing individuals and organizations to offset their carbon footprint.

### Sequence 

Sequence diagrams visually represent the interactions between various components in a system over time. They are particularly useful for illustrating the flow of messages and events in a specific order, making it easier to understand the sequence of processes within a system. Sequence diagrams help developers and stakeholders to identify and analyze the relationships between different objects or components and understand how they interact with one another. 

In this platform, a user interacts with the User Interface to buy carbon tokens. The interface sends a request to the Smart Contracts, which then records the transaction on the Blockchain. Once the transaction is confirmed, the Smart Contracts update the user's token balance in the interface, which then displays the updated balance. Meanwhile, an AI-based Algorithm generates data that the Data Analytics component analyzes. The analyzed data is sent back to the AI-based Algorithm, which then provides insights to the user through the User Interface.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives are:

-   To create a decentralized platform that issues carbon tokens on the Polygon blockchain.
-   To leverage reforestation initiatives to generate measurable and verifiable carbon offsets.
-   To incentivize reforestation efforts by using carbon tokens as a reward mechanism.
-   To provide a user-friendly platform for individuals and organizations to offset their carbon footprints.
-   To utilize open-source technologies and tools to maximize transparency, collaboration, and cost-effectiveness.

## Project Timeline

Creating a project timeline helps to establish deadlines, allocate resources, and track progress throughout the project lifecycle. The timeline should include key milestones, deliverables, and deadlines for each phase of the project. 
The timeline should be flexible enough to accommodate changes and adjustments as the project progresses, while still providing clear goals and deadlines to ensure timely progress.

### Phase 1:

This technical overview addresses the first phase of the project, which concentrates on preliminary project planning and high-level architecture design. In this phase, we will lay the groundwork for future development stages by outlining system requirements, project planning, architecture design, and other essential components.

It is important to note that this document will not delve into the implementation details or code-level aspects of the project. These topics will be tackled in subsequent phases as the project progresses and the team gains a better understanding of the requirements and potential challenges.

During the first phase, our primary objectives will include:

-   Identifying and analyzing the project requirements: We will gather information about the project's goals, objectives, and scope, as well as any constraints or limitations that may impact the project's success.

-   Developing a high-level architecture design: The team will work together to create an overall system architecture that addresses the identified requirements and provides a solid foundation for future development work.

-   Establishing a project plan: We will develop a comprehensive project plan that outlines the tasks, milestones, and deliverables required to complete the project, along with a realistic timeline and resource allocation.

-   Assembling the project team: Identifying the necessary roles and responsibilities for each team member will be crucial to ensure smooth collaboration and efficient progress throughout the project.

It is essential to recognize that the designs created during this initial phase will likely evolve over time. As the team moves forward with implementation, analyzes requirements more thoroughly, gathers stakeholder feedback, and encounters unforeseen challenges, the architecture and project plans will need to adapt accordingly.

By acknowledging these caveats and remaining flexible in our approach, we can ensure that the first phase of the project establishes a strong foundation upon which future development phases can build. As the project progresses, the team will continually reassess and refine the plans and designs, adapting them as needed to ensure the project's overall success.

#### Target Audience

The target audience for this technical documentation includes:

-   Project stakeholders: Individuals and organizations interested in the project's progress and outcomes.
-   Developers and engineers: Technical team members responsible for implementing and maintaining the platform.
-   Reforestation partners: Organizations and initiatives that will collaborate on reforestation efforts and carbon offset generation.
-   Users: Individuals and organizations interested in offsetting their carbon footprints and supporting reforestation initiatives.

### Phase 2:
Blockchain component and development of the platform until the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is reached
### Phase 3:
Complete development of the project
### Phase 4:
Maintenance of the platform - long term
