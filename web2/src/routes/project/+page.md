# Project Overview: Carbon Token Platform

The Carbon Token Platform is an innovative project that aims to revolutionize the carbon market by incorporating blockchain technology, smart contracts, and AI-driven data analytics. The platform is designed to make the process of purchasing and managing carbon tokens easy and efficient for users.

Component diagrams are used to visualize the organization and relationships among software components in a system. They depict high-level components, their interactions, and the dependencies between them. This type of diagram is particularly useful for representing the architecture of a software system and helps in understanding the functionality and organization of different components.

## Components

1. **User**: The end-user who interacts with the platform to purchase and manage carbon tokens.
2. **WebUI**: The web-based user interface that allows users to interact with the platform, view their carbon token balance, and purchase tokens.
    - [User Interface]
    - [Carbon Token Balance]
3. **Blockchain**: A decentralized database that records all transactions related to the carbon tokens.
4. **Smart Contracts (SC)**: Self-executing contracts that handle the purchase of tokens and recording of transactions on the blockchain.
5. **AI-based Algorithm (AI)**: An intelligent algorithm that generates data to help with decision-making and platform optimization.
6. **Data Analytics (DA)**: A component that analyzes the data generated by the AI-based algorithm and updates the carbon token balance.

## Connections

- User --> [User Interface] : Interact
- [User Interface] --> [Carbon Token Balance] : View balance
- [User Interface] --> SC : Purchase tokens
- SC --> Blockchain : Record transactions
- AI --> DA : Generate data
- DA --> [Carbon Token Balance] : Update balance

## Project Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Preliminary project planning and overall architecture design.
2. **Phase 2**: Blockchain component and development of platform till MVP.
3. **Phase 3**: Complete development of the project.
4. **Phase 4**: Maintenance of the platform - long term.

## Sequence of events

In this sequence diagram, we have the following interactions:

1. The user interacts with the platform through the User Interface (UI).
2. The UI sends a request to the Smart Contracts (SC) to purchase carbon tokens.
3. The SC records the transaction on the Blockchain.
4. The Blockchain confirms the transaction and sends the confirmation back to the SC.
5. The SC updates the user's carbon token balance in the UI.
6. The UI shows the updated balance to the user.
7. The AI-based Algorithm generates data and sends it to the Data Analytics (DA) component for analysis.
8. The DA analyzes the data and sends the results back to the AI-based Algorithm.
9. The AI-based Algorithm provides insights to the UI for the user's benefit.
