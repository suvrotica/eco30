# Carbon Credit Budget Plan

The project's budget is crucial for securing funding, allocating resources, and ensuring that the project's financial needs are met throughout its lifecycle.
## Budget Estimation

 The budget estimation should account for costs associated with development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, as well as any additional expenses related to marketing, partnerships, or regulatory compliance. Key budgetary considerations may include:

- Personnel Costs: Salaries, benefits, and other compensation for the project team, including developers, engineers, project managers, quality assurance personnel, and other experts.
- Hardware and Infrastructure: Expenses related to the development, testing, and production environments, including servers, networking equipment, and other hardware.
- Software Licenses: Costs associated with any proprietary software, tools, subscriptions, or services required for the project.
- Marketing and Outreach: Expenses related to promoting the platform, attracting users and reforestation partners, and building brand awareness.
- Partnerships and Collaborations: Costs associated with establishing and maintaining relationships with open-source initiatives, regulatory authorities, or other relevant organizations.
- Contingency Funds: A reserve budget to cover unexpected expenses or cost overruns during the project's development and implementation. An additional contingency fund of 15% of the total monthly project cost should be allocated to address any unforeseen costs or financial risks that may arise during the project's implementation.

## System Requirements

In this section, we will outline the minimum hardware and software requirements necessary to support the development, deployment, and operation of the platform. These requirements will ensure the platform's performance, security, and reliability while keeping costs and resource consumption within reasonable limits.

### Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements per team participant, for the project can be divided into three main categories: development environment, testing environment, and production environment. These requirements will be subject to change as the project progresses and may need to be updated in later phases.

1. Development Environment:
   - A modern computer with a multi-core processor, at least 8 GB of RAM, and sufficient storage space for the development tools, source code, and supporting files.
   - High-speed internet connection to facilitate collaboration, access to resources, and version control.

2. Testing Environment:
   - A dedicated server or cloud-based environment with a multi-core processor, at least 16 GB of RAM, and adequate storage space to host the platform's components and accommodate test data.
   - High-speed internet connection for remote access, monitoring, and performance analysis.

3. Production Environment:
   - A scalable infrastructure capable of hosting the platform's components, such as cloud-based servers or dedicated server clusters, with sufficient processing power, memory, and storage to handle anticipated user loads and data storage requirements.
   - Redundant and geographically distributed nodes to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and optimal performance for users worldwide.
   - Robust network infrastructure with sufficient bandwidth and security measures to protect against unauthorized access and potential attacks.

### Software Requirements

The software requirements for the project are crucial to ensure that the platform is built using reliable, secure, and efficient technologies. The project will rely on open-source software wherever possible to reduce costs, increase transparency, and facilitate collaboration.

1. Operating System: A modern operating system, such as Windows, to support the development environment and server infrastructure.
2. Polygon Blockchain: Integration with the Polygon blockchain network for issuing and managing carbon tokens.
3. Smart Contract Development: Utilization of Solidity smart contract language compatible with the Polygon network for carbon token smart contract development.
4. Backend Development: A suitable backend framework and programming language, such as Node.js to support the platform's API, data processing, and business logic.
5. Database Management System: A scalable and reliable database management system, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB, to store and manage user data, reforestation initiatives, and carbon token transactions.
6. Frontend Development: A modern frontend framework, such as Sveltekit, for building a user-friendly interface and responsive web application.
7. Version Control System: A version control system, such as Git, for managing source code, collaborating on development tasks, and tracking changes throughout the project lifecycle.
8. Continuous Integration and Deployment: A CI/CD pipeline, such as GitHub Actions, to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the platform components.

### Network Infrastructure

The network infrastructure for the project must be designed to support the platform's requirements for scalability, security, and performance. The following considerations should be taken into account when designing the network infrastructure:

- Connectivity: High-speed internet connections for development, testing, and production environments to ensure efficient communication, access to resources, and data transfer.
- Scalability: Network infrastructure capable of handling increased user loads and data storage requirements as the platform grows, such as the use of load balancers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and autoscaling server clusters.
- Security: Implementation of security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption, to protect the platform from unauthorized access, data breaches, and attacks.
- Monitoring and Maintenance: Tools and processes for monitoring network performance, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
- Redundancy and Disaster Recovery: Geographically distributed nodes and backup systems to minimize downtime and ensure high availability in the event of hardware failures, network outages, or other incidents.
