# Architecture Design

The system architecture of the Carbon Token on the Polygon Blockchain project is comprised of several interconnected components that work together to provide an efficient, secure, and user-friendly platform. The project uses modern and reliable technologies to ensure a seamless and transparent experience for its users.

The frontend of the platform is built using the SvelteKit framework, which offers several advantages over traditional frameworks, such as improved performance and faster load times. Users can purchase carbon tokens, view their token balance, and monitor their carbon offsetting progress through this responsive and intuitive interface.

The SvelteKit application is deployed on Vercel, a reliable and scalable hosting platform that specializes in deploying frontend applications with ease. Vercel offers a range of benefits, including automatic SSL, global CDN, and seamless integration with popular version control systems like Git. The SSL protocol is implemented to enhance the security and trustworthiness of the platform, protecting user data, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Decentralized hosting alternatives such as Unstoppable Domains, Fleek IPFS, and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) are explored to ensure a fully decentralized environment and guarantee the platform's stability and scalability.

Integration with the Polygon blockchain is facilitated through web3 MetaMask connections and WalletConnect, providing a convenient and secure way for users to interact with the platform. Alchemy is also used to facilitate communication with the blockchain, ensuring that transactions are processed quickly and efficiently.

Overall, the use of modern and reliable technologies in the system architecture of the Carbon Token on the Polygon Blockchain project ensures a seamless and transparent experience for users, while also prioritizing security, stability, and scalability.

The Layered Architecture Approach is a software design pattern that organizes the components of a system into distinct layers, providing a specific set of functionalities to ensure separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and modularity in the system.

The Carbon Token Project on the Polygon Blockchain utilizes the Layered Architecture Approach, which is divided into four main layers:

1. Presentation Layer (Frontend/WebUI)
2. Application Layer (APIs/Logic)
3. Smart Contracts Layer (Blockchain)
4. Data Layer (Blockchain & Analytics)

The Presentation Layer is responsible for providing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for the Carbon Token platform. The frontend is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SvelteKit framework, providing users with a responsive and intuitive interface to interact with the platform.

The Application Layer contains the business logic and APIs for the Carbon Token platform. It includes the communication between the frontend and the smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain, as well as the integration of the AI-based algorithm for carbon offsetting measurement. This layer is responsible for processing user requests, managing token transactions, and ensuring the proper functioning of the platform.

The Smart Contracts Layer comprises the smart contracts that manage the issuance and tracking of carbon tokens on the Polygon blockchain. The smart contracts handle token transactions, manage tokenomics, and ensure the security and transparency of the platform.

The Data Layer is responsible for storing and managing data related to the Carbon Token platform. It includes the Polygon blockchain, which records all token transactions, and the data analytics module, which analyzes data generated by the AI-based algorithm to determine the amount of carbon offsetting achieved by the reforestation efforts.

The Layered Architecture Approach provides several benefits, including effective separation of different functionalities and concerns, making it easier to maintain, update, and scale individual components of the system as needed. This approach also allows for better testing and quality assurance, as each layer can be tested and modified independently.

## Data Flow Diagram

A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) provides a visual representation of how data flows through a system. It helps to understand the flow of data between different components and processes in the system. Here is a textual description of the Data Flow Diagram for the Carbon Token project:

1. User Interaction:
   The user interacts with the Frontend (WebUI) to purchase carbon tokens, view their token balance, and monitor their carbon offsetting progress.
2. Frontend (WebUI) to Backend (APIs/Logic):
   The frontend sends user requests to the backend, which processes the requests and manages token transactions.
3. Backend (APIs/Logic) to Smart Contracts (Polygon Blockchain):
   The backend communicates with the smart contracts to perform token issuance, token transactions, and tokenomics management.
4. Smart Contracts (Polygon Blockchain) to Data Layer (Blockchain & Analytics):
   The smart contracts store token transactions on the Polygon Blockchain, and the data analytics module receives data for carbon offsetting measurement.
5. Data Layer (Blockchain & Analytics) to AI-based Algorithm (Carbon Offsetting Measurement):
   The data analytics module sends data to the AI-based algorithm, which calculates the carbon offsetting achieved through reforestation efforts.
6. AI-based Algorithm (Carbon Offsetting Measurement) to Backend (APIs/Logic):
   The AI-based algorithm sends the carbon offsetting measurements back to the backend, which updates the user's carbon offsetting progress.
7. Backend (APIs/Logic) to Frontend (WebUI):
   The backend sends updated information, including the user's token balance and carbon offsetting progress, back to the frontend for display.
